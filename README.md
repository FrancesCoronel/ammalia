## Name

`Ammalia` means surgery in Arabic

## Team

Big Hero 4

## Slogan

Where surgeons go to explore.

## Description

Ammalia is a Leap Motion assisted app that allows a surgeon to analyze pictures of their patient's problem (i.e. brain tumors) using the Dropbox API.

## Tools

- Leap Motion
- Dropbox API
    - use Dropbox for uploading/storing images for patient’s problems
    - have folders within Dropbox API represent a single patient
    - surgeon will have to login to Dropbox account
- Authentication (secondary)
    - look into different avenues for this since Dropbox may not be the most ideal solution
    - potentially add an extra layer of security in order for surgeon to access medical records/photos

## Future features

1. We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time.

2. Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation.

3. Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase different health record data points that pertain to the patient being showcased
(i.e. name, age, background, etc).

## Pitch

<i>
Hi!

We are Big Hero 4 and we created Ammalia, which means surgery in Arabic.

We created a Leap Motion assisted application that utilizes the Dropbox API to showcase pictures of patients for surgeons or doctors to easily view and manipulate while they’re in the OR.

## Potential Questions & Answers

- Why would a surgeon want to login using Dropbox?

> We figured we would use Dropbox oAuth for the surgeons since the mentors for Dropbox were available to us at TreeHacks. This also made it easier to showcase the data.

- Use cases?

> The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in & sterile in the OR.
