<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Ammalia is a Leap Motion assisted app that allows a surgeon to analyze pictures of their patient&#8217;s problem (i.e. brain tumors) using the Dropbox API.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li>Leap Motion</li>
<li>Dropbox API

<ul>
<li>use Dropbox for uploading/storing images for patient’s problems</li>
<li>have folders within Dropbox API represent a single patient</li>
<li>surgeon will have to login to Dropbox account</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Authentication (secondary)

<ul>
<li>look into different avenues for this since Dropbox may not be the most ideal solution</li>
<li>potentially add an extra layer of security in order for surgeon to access medical records/photos</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="futurefeatures">Future features</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>We can see Ammalia potentially pivoting to include 3D manipulation of MRI and CT scans mid-procedure, which is important when, for example, determining the extent of a tumor in real-time.</p></li>
<li><p>Another area we could look into is radiology and cardiology intervention which would actually involve catheter manipulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, depending on the patient chosen, Ammalia could also showcase different health record data points that pertain to the patient being showcased
(i.e. name, age, background, etc).</p></li>

Hi!</p>

<p>We are Big Hero 4 and we created Ammalia, which means surgery in Arabic.</p>

<p>We created a Leap Motion assisted application that utilizes the Dropbox API to showcase pictures of patients for surgeons or doctors to easily view and manipulate while they’re in the OR.

<h2 id="potentialquestionsanswers">Potential Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why would a surgeon want to login using Dropbox?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>We figured we would use Dropbox oAuth for the surgeons since the mentors for Dropbox were available to us at TreeHacks. This also made it easier to showcase the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Use cases?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The areas we believe Ammalia could be the most useful is with radiology image manipulation / scrolling while scrubbed in &amp; sterile in the OR.</p>
